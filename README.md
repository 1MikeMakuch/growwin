* Applescripts to increase size of window on one edge

* I use FastScripts to invoke each of the four scripts with a keyboard shortcut, namely

  Control + Shift + arrow

* I use these in conjunction with SizeUp. SizeUp allows you to position any application window in one of the 4 quarters of the screen or in 1 of the 4 halves of the screen. These scripts allow you to enlarge one window on one edge at a time. 

* Thanks to
