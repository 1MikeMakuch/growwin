# growwin - scripts to arrange and resize Mac desktop windows via keyboard shortcuts

* Applescripts to increase size of window on one edge with keyboard shortcuts (without mouse)

* I use FastScripts to invoke each of the four scripts with a keyboard shortcut, namely

  Control + Shift + arrow

* I use these in conjunction with SizeUp. SizeUp allows you to position any application window in one of the four quarters of the screen (lower left, upper left, x 2 for right) or in one of the four halves (upper, lower, left, right) of the screen. These growwin scripts allow you to enlarge one window on one edge at a time by a configurable percentage, default 25%.
